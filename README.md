My #100DaysOfCodeChallenge 
Here I will solve Leetcode questions and maintain the streak for minimum 100 days !!

## Day 1:
- Did Two recursion questions.

## Day 2:
- Did two problems using recursion and backtracking.
	- One was a implementations of Bubble sort(similar).
	- Another was based on backtracking and subsequences.

## Day 3:
- Did two array problems.
	- [Easy] used recursion and a loop together to find the number of elements of an array, that are even digit.

	- [Medium] used recursion to solve (array product except self),exceeded time limit so used different approach

## Day 4:
- Did two array problems.
	- [Easy] Highest Altitude using prefix sum.
	- [medium] Spiral matrix
